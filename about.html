        <h1>About Us</h1><br>
        <p>As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.

            While wildlife photographs can be taken using basic equipment, successful photography of some types of wildlife requires specialist equipment, such as macro lenses for insects, long focal length lenses for birds and underwater cameras for marine life.
            
            History
            
            Ottomar Anschütz's images of white storks (Ciconia ciconia), taken in 1884
            
            Photograph of a Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) incubating its eggs, for which in 1895 R. B. Lodge received from the Royal Photographic Society the first medal ever presented for nature photography. Eric Hosking and Harold Lowes stated their belief – incorrectly – that this was the first photograph of a wild bird.[1]
            In the early days of photography, it was difficult to get a photograph of wildlife due to slow lenses and the low sensitivity of photographic media.[2] Earlier photos of animals were often of captive ones.[3][4] These included photos of lion cubs taken at the Bristol zoo in 1854 and in 1864, photos of the last Quagga by Frank Hayes.[5] Wildlife photography gained more traction when faster photography emulsions and quicker shutters came in the 1880s.[6] Developments like these lead to photos such as the ones taken by German Ottomar Anschutz in 1884, the first shots of wild birds in action.[6] Members of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) captured early photographs of nesting songbirds in the Philadelphia area in 1897.[7] In July 1906, National Geographic published its first wildlife photos.[8] The photos were taken by George Shiras III, a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania. Some of his photos were taken with the first wire-tripped camera traps</p>

        <h1>History and profile</h1><br>
        <p>The magazine features photography, stories and articles on nature and wildlife. The magazine also reports on new discoveries[1][2] about wildlife and wild animal behavior, how to garden naturally using native plants and how to attract birds,[3] butterflies and other wildlife to backyards and gardens.[4]

            In November 2014 Lisa Moore was appointed editor-in-chief of National Wildlife.[5][6] She replaced Mark Wexler in the post.[6]
            
            Information, advice and tips are also provided on the National Wildlife Magazine website on wildlife gardening, birding, wildlife photography, wildlife/animals and outdoor family activities.
            
            The magazine has won many awards for its wildlife photography including Pictures of the Year International awards in 2004[7] and 2005.[8]
            
            Annual Photography Contest
            National Wildlife magazine also offers an annual Photography Contest[9] and has done so for 40 years. Winners from the Photo Contest are published in the Magazine and on the Magazine website.[10][11][12]
